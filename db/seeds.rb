  <p>
    On the road to our dreams and goals each of us has certain assets or resources that help us get there.  For instance, some people may have:
    <blockquote>
      Financial assets:  money in the bank or a computer or a car they own<br />
      Personal assets:  the ability to work well on a team - or on their own<br />
      Network assets:  connections to people who can help<br />
      Experience assets:  previous jobs, school projects, life experiences they can draw on.
    </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone\'s situation is different:  you can feel you have lots of resources in some areas. But in other areas you may have no experience or feel like you are out on your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what is <strong>your situation</strong>? Answering these questions will help you figure which assets are there for you - and which ones you might want to develop.
