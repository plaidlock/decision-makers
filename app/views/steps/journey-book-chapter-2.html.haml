%h2 Step 4: Create a Portrait of Yourself as a Decision Maker
%p The first chapter that will go in your Journey Book is—of course—about you! So write a story about some of the decisions you have made and about what you learned from your experience.
%p To get ideas for this portrait of yourself, start just as Brian and Stephanie did. Begin a discussion with your group. Tell your Story-Behind-the-Story . Let them act as your Planning Partners. Here’s how.

%h3 How do you being a story-behind-the-story dialogue?
%table{:cellpadding => 5}
  %tr
    %th{:width => '50%'} What the Story-teller Does
    %th{:width => '50%'} What the Planning Partners Do
  %tr
    %td
      %p
        %strong Start the Story
      %p You are the story teller, so tell us about the problem you faced. Make your story lead up to the point at which you had to make a difficult decision.
      %p But as soon as you describe that moment &mdash; before you tell us what you did or why &mdash; STOP!
    %td
      %strong Listen with imagination
  %tr
    %td
      %p
        %strong Ask for Predictions
      %p Now ask us to predict what we think you did. See <u>how many</u> rival hypotheses you can get us to imagine.
      %p As the story teller, you get to ask us 3 hard questions:
      %ul.dialogue
        %li What <u>decision</u> do you think I made? And why?
        %li What do you think the <u>problem</u> is here?
        %li Whose problem is it?
    %td
      %p
        %strong Predict Rival Possibilities
      %p See how many different <u>rival</u> hypotheses you can imagine:
      %ul.dialogue
        %li What did the story teller decide?
        %li What is the real problem here?
        %li Whose problem is it?
  %tr
    %td
      %p
        %strong Reveal the Story
      %p Tell us about your decision:
      %ul.dialogue
        %li What did you do?
        %li What did you do?
        %li What is the problem here?
        %li If it was a bad decision, how did you recover?
      %p
        %em Tip: Jot down good rivals and your own answers. Include these when you write your Portrait for Chapter One
    %td
      %p
        %strong Get the Story-Behind-the-Story
      %p Here is where you &mdash; the planning partner &mdash; can help the story teller dig deeper. Your job is to ask:
      %ul.dialogue
        %li <u>Why?</u> What is the real problem here?
        %li How did you <u>feel</u> about yourself? Were you proud of something? Did other people see it the same way?
        %li Did you <u>learn</u> something from this experience about yourself or others?

    Before you tell your story, be sure you know how to **rival**. Then come back for a **Story-behind-the-Story** discussion with your group.

%h3 Tips for writing your story
%p Write your story like you told it. Give a dramatic description leading up to the climax—the point at which you had to make a decision. Stop.
%ul.clipboard
  %li Tell the story-behind-the-story &mdash; this is the story that only you can tell about how you felt and what it really meant to you. Remember, you are the expert here &mdash; the one with the "insider" knowledge. For instance, you might use the story-behind-the-story strategy to help adults understand this problem or decision &mdash; from a teenager's point of view.
  %li Compare the <strong>rival hypotheses</strong> your partners came up with to what you really did? What is the story-behind-the-story here? Why did you do what you did? And what did you learn?
  %li When you have written your first draft of your stories, use the check list below to review them and see how many signs of strong decision making you were using.

  %h3 Are You Read to Write Your Portrait
  .clear
  %p This portrait of you as a decision maker includes 2 stories: One is about a good decision and one about a bad decision &mdash; and how you recovered from it.
  %ul.pencil
    %li Start with the <strong>good</strong> or the <strong>bad</strong> decision. Include ideas you heard in the story-behind-the-story discussion. Do the rivals tell you something about yourself as a decision maker?

  %h3 Review Your Stories

      %td <strong>Specifics</strong>: It is detailed and elaborated with specifics

      %td <strong>Steps</strong>: It spells out specific actions or steps I took
    %tr
      %td
      %td <strong>Personal fit</strong>: It is personal and clearly refers to my situation (beyond what anyone might say about this general problem)
    %tr
      %td
      %td <strong>Reasons</strong>: It goes further to explain my idea by giving reasons with words like "since" or "because" or "so."
    %tr
      %td
      %td <strong>Rivals</strong>: It raises rivals and talks about alternatives to my own ideas
