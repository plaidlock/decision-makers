      %p You have completed a big step on the journey to becoming a <strong>Strong Decision Maker</strong>.
      %ol
        %li You have looked at your goals, assets and network of support.
        %li You have created a portrait of yourself as a decision maker &mdash; past and future
        %li Your have learned 4 powerful strategies for planning and decision making

%h3 What is the next step on your journey?
%p Chapter 3 is a place to name your goals, set milestones, and record your accomplishments. It's the place to think about these questions:
%ul.dialogue
  %li What are the goals of the program I am in?
  %li What do "I" want to get out of it?
  %li What are my personal goals?
  %li How will I know if I am getting closer?

%h3 Start a portfolio of plans
%ul.pencil
  %li <strong>Write a letter to yourself</strong>. Write a letter to the person you will be (the person who will read this letter) a few months from now. Tell your self what you really <strong>plan</strong> to accomplish.
  %li <strong>Set Milestones</strong>. Turn that plan into a <strong>timeline</strong> &mdash; when should things happen? &mdash; or a set of milestones. Milestones are the small steps and signs of progress along the way that show you are getting closer your goals.

%h3 Keep a record of progress and strengths
%ul.check
  %li <strong>Check off Milestones</strong>. Check in with your timeline. Reward yourself for keeping on your schedule. Every time you reach a milestone, check it off and celebrate!
  %li <strong>Collect Evidence of your Strengths</strong>. You can assess your own strengths and progress by looking for situations in which you made a good decision. Think it over: what made it a strong decision: did you consider reasons, rivals, roadblocks? Write it down in your journal or on your memory.
  %li <strong>Share your Story</strong>. If you donâ€™t speak up for your strengths, who will? Let others know about the decisions you faced and how you handled them &mdash; on a regular basis. Then when you are talking to your supervisor or instructor, or applying for an Internship or job, use your stories of strong decision making to describe your self.
